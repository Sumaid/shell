												Interactive User Defined Shell

1)Shell Prompt with username and Operating system name appears.Current directory also appears.
  First time when shell is invoked,that directory is considered root or "~",and hence any inner directories follow pattern from here.

2)pwd
  - Shows currect working directory with respect to root directory of system(not shell)

3)echo 
  INPUT                                                                 OUTPUT 
  echo argument                                        ->               argument
  echo arg1        arg2                                ->               arg1 arg2
  echo "arg1          arg2"                            ->               arg1          arg2
  echo 'arg1          arg2'                            ->               arg1          arg2

4)ls
  INPUT                                                                 OUTPUT 
  ls                                                   ->               (Regular ls output)
  ls file1 file2 file3....                             ->               (ls output on each file-any number of arguments)
  ls dir file file2                                    ->               (ls output within dir and on each file)
  ls -[al]                                             ->               (Works on individual file also)
  																		(Hidden files appear only with -a flag)
  																		(Output looks exactly like original shell)
